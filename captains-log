Captain's Log Day 21
Date: Oct 2, 2020

  Steve from Minecraft was just announced as the newest fighter in Super Smash Bros Ultimate yesterday. Tomorrow, he is released. 
  For a small price of 5.99, my roommate and I will likely play Smash all day as Steve until we are so tired of it, we pass out.
  That is all, more next time. Take care.
